# Simple Weather App

A clean and responsive weather app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. This app allows users to search for the current weather in any city worldwide, displaying real-time temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed using a public weather API.

It features a user-friendly interface, minimal design, and mobile responsiveness. Built without any frameworks, itâ€™s a great beginner-friendly project for learning API integration, DOM manipulation, and basic front-end interactivity.

Ideal for anyone looking to understand how to work with APIs and display dynamic data on a static web page.
